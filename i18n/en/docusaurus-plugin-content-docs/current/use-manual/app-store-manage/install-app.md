## Install from the market

Rainbond proposes an application model, the Rainbond Application Model (RAM), which is the standard Rainbond application specification.Based on this model and Rainbond's application market mechanism, one-click installation/upgrade is finally realized.The highly automated delivery experience improves enterprise application delivery efficiency and reduces delivery costs.

The application marketplaces provided by Rainbond are divided into two categories:

**1. Local component library**

:::info

The local component library is the application market that comes with Rainbond, and all the application templates you publish under this enterprise can be saved here.Other users within the enterprise can quickly replicate the application by installing the application template from the local component repository.Publishing to the local component library can refer to: [a reusable application template](/use-manual/get-start/release-to-market.md).

:::

**2. Open source app store**

:::info

The open source application store is an application market officially supported by Haoyu Technology. All Rainbonds can connect to this market and install the above applications with one click.

:::

The main difference between the local component library and the cloud application market is that the applications you publish in the local component library can only be circulated in the deployed Rainbond environment.Applications published to the cloud application market can be installed in multiple Rainbond environments with one click.
